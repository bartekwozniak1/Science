  "introduction": "Emotions feel automatic, like uncontrollable reactions to the world.  For over two thousand years, science and society have embraced the classical view that emotions are inborn, hardwired, and universally expressed.  However, groundbreaking research is overturning this long-held understanding.  'How Emotions Are Made' proposes a revolutionary theory: emotions aren't triggered, but actively *constructed* by your brain, moment by moment.  This new perspective challenges the very foundations of how we understand ourselves, our relationships, and our place in the world, inviting a complete reevaluation of how we experience and interpret feelings.",
  "summary": {
    "chapter_1": "Chapter 1 - The Enduring Myth of Universal Emotions: *How Emotions Are Made* challenges the widely-held belief that emotions are universally expressed and recognized, a concept rooted in the classical view of emotion.\nFor centuries, the classical view of emotion has dominated Western thought, claiming that emotions are inborn, recognizable phenomena with distinct fingerprints in the face, body, and brain. This view, popularized by figures like Charles Darwin, suggests that emotions are universal and shared across cultures and even with some animals. However, a century of research has consistently failed to find consistent, physical fingerprints for any single emotion. When scientists measure facial muscle movements, bodily changes, or brain activity during emotional experiences, they find tremendous variation, not uniformity.  This directly contradicts the classical view's assumption of universality, challenging the notion that a specific set of facial movements, like a scowl for anger or a smile for happiness, reliably indicates a particular emotion. The classical view assumes emotions are triggered as if a switch were flipped. We broadcast our emotions on our faces by way of smiles, frowns, scowls, and other characteristic expressions that anyone can easily recognize. Our voices reveal our emotions through laughter, shouts, and cries, and our body posture betrays our feelings with every gesture and slouch. This classical view can be seen everywhere, from *Lie to Me* and *Daredevil*, to Sesame Street.",
    "chapter_2": "Chapter 2 - Deconstructing the Classical View: A New Vision of Emotions: Emotions are not inborn, universally recognized reactions but are actively constructed by the brain. It uses interoceptive information, concepts, and past experiences to give meaning to sensations.\nEmotions are not inborn, universally recognized reactions but are actively constructed by the brain. It uses interoceptive information, concepts, and past experiences to give meaning to sensations. Consider the example of seeing a blurry image—what might appear as formless blobs at first becomes a recognizable object (a bee, in a demonstration) once the brain has the relevant knowledge to draw on. This process, called simulation, demonstrates that the brain actively constructs perceptions, adding information from past experiences to make sense of sensory input. This same process applies to emotions. Instead of being triggered reactions, emotions emerge from the brain's construction of meaning from bodily sensations in the context of the surrounding world. An emotion is a meaning that your brain has constructed of bodily changes, combined with events in the external world. For instance, a fluttering stomach and a flushing face might be interpreted as attraction, but they could just as easily be symptoms of the flu, depending on the situation. This means emotions are real, but they are not objective, pre-existing entities within us. They are, in a sense, products of human agreement, just like the concept of money. This new understanding, called the 'theory of constructed emotion,' offers a radically different interpretation of how emotions work, emphasizing their variability, cultural dependence, and active construction by the brain.\n\nThis new theory is unintuitive, and at odds with most people’s experience. However, if you think back to Governor Malloy’s “State of the State” address in 2012, you can see how emotions like Malloy’s, which seem hardwired and universally shared, are in fact products of learning. It seemed like the speech triggered a brain circuit for sadness inside, causing a set of bodily changes. However, the experience of sadness in that moment was learned, from being raised in a certain culture. “Sadness” is something that may occur when certain bodily feelings happen at the same time as a terrible loss. Using bits of experience and knowledge, the brain predicts what the body should do to cope with the tragedy, which causes those feelings, and the actions that will calm the nervous system. The brain made the sensations meaningful as sadness. In the same way, when encountering a new or ambiguous situation, the brain uses past experiences (concepts) to interpret sensory input and generate appropriate actions. The theory of constructed emotion challenges the classical view, suggesting that emotions are not pre-programmed reactions but are actively built from more basic components, varying across cultures and situations.",
    "chapter_3": "Chapter 3 -The Brain's Predictive Power: Unveiling the Construction Process: The brain's primary mode of operation is prediction. The brain uses past experiences to construct hypotheses about the world and compares them to incoming sensory input, using simulation.\nContrary to the classical view, the brain does not passively react to the world but actively predicts it. Constantly generating simulations based on past experiences, the brain creates a model of what it expects to encounter next. This predictive process allows for efficient interaction with the environment, as the brain doesn't have to process every sensory detail as new information.  If predictions are accurate, the brain operates smoothly; if not, it adjusts its model.  This constant interplay of prediction and correction shapes our perception and experience. The brain doesn't just passively receive sensory input; it actively constructs it. For instance, when you view a photograph, your brain simulates various possibilities based on past experiences. These simulations guide your interpretation of what you see, making a blurry image suddenly recognizable or causing you to perceive a particular emotion on someone's face. This concept of prediction extends beyond perception to actions as well. The brain initiates movements before we're consciously aware of our intention to move, a phenomenon sometimes called 'the illusion of free will.' This predictive capacity demonstrates that emotions are not triggered reactions but constructions based on the brain's best guesses about the meaning of sensations in context. The “basic emotion method,” a standard technique in emotion research, where subjects are asked to match posed facial expressions to emotion words. Originally, this method was taken as strong evidence for the universality of emotional expressions. However, when the method is altered—such as by removing the emotion words—people's ability to accurately identify the intended emotions plummets. This strongly suggests that the emotion words themselves were unconsciously priming the participants, guiding their perception. For example, a study by psychologist Lisa Feldman Barrett used photos from a book called *In Character: Actors Acting*, where actors portray emotions by posing their faces in ways that match specific scenarios. If subjects saw the scenario first, their interpretation of the emotion would match the scenario, and vary widely, even if the facial expression would typically be used to indicate a specific emotion. For example, if a subject saw a picture of Martin Landau, and read the text “he just witnessed a shooting on his quiet, tree-shaded block in Brooklyn,” the subject would categorize the image as fear. But subjects who saw just the image would categorize it as surprise.\n\nIn essence, concepts provide a form of pre-loaded knowledge that influences what we perceive. Further experiments, involving removing emotion words, and even temporarily disrupting access to emotion concepts in participants' brains, demonstrate that people's ability to perceive emotions in others is significantly impaired when their own emotion concepts are unavailable. Even infants, who lack fully developed emotion concepts, struggle to distinguish between different facial expressions, relying more on context than facial movements alone. The “basic emotion method” is flawed, not because of its methods, but because it assumes that emotions are pre-programmed. Even Paul Ekman's research in Papa New Guinea in the 1960s may have been affected by this.",
    "chapter_4": "Chapter 4 - Feeling and Interoception: The Body's Role in Constructed Emotions: The origin of feelings, specifically those tied to emotion, lies in interoception, the brain's representation of sensations from within the body. Interoception is always happening, providing the raw material for affective feelings.\nInteroception, the brain's representation of internal bodily sensations, is a key ingredient in how we experience emotions. This constant stream of information from our organs, hormones, and immune system gives rise to basic feelings of pleasure, displeasure, calmness, and agitation—what scientists call affect. These feelings are always present, but they are not emotions themselves. The interoceptive network, a key part of the brain, uses past experiences to predict the body's needs and to guide actions. These predictions generate simulations that become our experiences, shaping not just our emotions but our perceptions of the world. Our brains use concepts to categorize our physical feelings, in much the same way that it categorizes visual input. So the same stomach ache can be interpreted as hunger, the flu, or even as a feeling. Interoception is not just about feeling your body; it is the foundation for creating meaning. When the interoceptive network's predictions involve emotion concepts, the brain constructs instances of emotion, making meaning from internal sensations and the surrounding context. This process is continuous and largely unconscious, explaining why emotions often feel automatic and triggered rather than actively constructed. The brain's primary task is not reacting to stimuli but predicting them. This predictive activity is structured by intrinsic networks of neurons that fire together. These networks continuously simulate the world based on past experiences, anticipating sensory input and guiding actions. This process is highly efficient, allowing us to navigate the world without being overwhelmed by constant sensory details. The brain continually adjusts its predictions when they don't match the incoming sensory input. When prediction errors occur, the brain can either change the prediction to accommodate the new information, or filter the sensory input to maintain the original prediction. This constant dance of prediction and correction shapes our perception of reality. The interplay of the interoceptive network, the control network, and other brain regions creates the diverse experiences we label as emotions. This process is not limited to emotions; it underlies all mental activity, including thoughts, memories, and perceptions. We can also influence the predictive power of our brains: when we’re stressed, we can reduce the level of threat that we predict. For example, when scientists played a loud tone before giving a rat an electric shock, the rat would freeze. This is because the amygdala helps a rat learn that a tone predicts a shock. The scientists used a rat’s freezing in this “fear learning” experiment as evidence that there is a specific circuit that controls fear. But this is the result of making a mental inference, not the existence of an emotion circuit. The circuit itself has a much wider range of action. And in fact, rats in different situations do not necessarily freeze. Some may even run around.",
"chapter_5": "Chapter 5 - Concepts, Goals, and Words: Building Blocks of the Emotional Mind: The brain constructs concepts, which are not fixed definitions but are adaptable and goal-based. This process includes forming emotion concepts, which are rooted in interoception and shaped by language and culture.\nThe human brain is remarkably skilled at constructing concepts, mental categories that group together objects, events, or actions based on shared meaning. Concepts are not fixed definitions stored in the brain but are dynamic, goal-based constructions that emerge in the moment, tailored to the specific situation. For example, the concept of \"chair\" is not just a list of features, such as a seat, and back, but a flexible mental category that can include various types of chairs, as well as objects with similar functions that don’t fit the typical definition. A chair, a stool, and even a large rock can fit into the concept of “chair.” This flexibility is particularly evident in emotion concepts, which are highly variable and depend on the context and the individual's goals. The key to understanding how emotions are made lies in the brain's ability to categorize using concepts. This process isn't a conscious, deliberate effort, but a rapid, automatic function of the brain, constantly predicting and explaining sensory input. The brain uses concepts to impose meaning on the cacophony of sensations from both the external world and the internal environment. The concepts are learned through a process called statistical learning, in which the infant brain absorbs sensory input and begins to understand its meaning. This ability allows us to organize knowledge in an efficient way, by learning statistical regularities in sensory input. In the same way that a child learns to divide the sounds of speech into phonemes, syllables and words, they can also learn to categorize facial expressions and bodily movements. For example, an infant doesn't enter the world knowing the concept of \"Anger.\" However, by encountering various instances of people expressing anger – shouting, scowling, frowning – and hearing the word \"angry\" used in those contexts, the child begins to construct a mental category. The word \"angry\" serves as an invitation to find the commonalities among these diverse instances. The child learns that “angry” doesn’t have a universal expression, but that it’s a diverse category. The child learns that in some situations, anger might involve shouting and a pounding heart, but in others, it might involve a calm and quiet demeanor. Eventually, this concept becomes a tool for predicting and understanding others' behavior and for constructing one's own emotional experiences.",
   "chapter_6": "Chapter 6 - The Social Reality of Emotions: Emotions are not just internal events but exist as social realities, constructed and shared within a culture. The power of social agreement and shared concepts shape how emotions are perceived and experienced.\nEmotions are not just personal, internal experiences but social realities, constructed and shared within a culture. Just as money exists because we collectively agree on its value, emotions gain meaning and function through shared concepts and agreement. These shared concepts enable us to communicate our emotional experiences, to perceive emotions in others, and even to regulate each other's body budgets. This process of constructing social reality involves not only shared concepts but also language. Words play a crucial role in how we learn and transmit emotion concepts. For example, the word 'sadness' invites us to find the similarities among diverse instances of feeling down, even if those instances don't share a single physical fingerprint. This social construction of emotions highlights the cultural diversity of emotional experience. Different cultures have different emotion concepts, reflecting their unique values and norms. Just as different languages have words for concepts that don't exist in English, cultures can have emotional experiences that don't translate neatly into other languages. This cultural variation underscores the fact that emotions are not merely biological reactions but are shaped by our social environment and upbringing. The power of social reality extends beyond emotions. It shapes how we perceive and interact with the world, influencing everything from our beliefs about other people to our understanding of what constitutes food. For instance, when individuals move to a new culture, they go through a process called emotional acculturation, in which they adopt the emotions that are common in the new culture. This social dimension of emotions highlights the need for emotional intelligence, which involves not just recognizing emotions in others but also understanding the cultural context that shapes those emotions.",
"chapter_7":"Chapter 7 - Implications of the Theory of Constructed Emotion: This chapter discusses the importance of emotion concepts for making emotions meaningful, and the far-reaching consequences of understanding the concept of social reality, including its impact on emotional experience and perception.\nUnderstanding emotions as constructions has a number of practical implications, and it requires a new understanding of how emotions are made. We can improve our emotional lives by attending to our body budget, expanding our emotion concepts, and cultivating emotional granularity. A more balanced and diverse concept system can improve the capacity to regulate emotions. This is because the brain can use the concepts to interpret bodily sensations in context. This might mean getting more sleep, engaging in regular physical activity, or immersing oneself in new experiences. You might also learn new emotion words and focus on deconstructing emotional experiences. By recognizing that emotions are actively constructed, we gain a greater sense of control over our emotional lives and become architects of our own experiences. Emotions are not simply reactions to the world but are actively constructed by the brain in the moment, using past experiences, interoceptive information, and concepts. This theory emphasizes the role of interoception, the constant stream of sensations from our body, in shaping our emotions. When we understand emotions as constructions, we gain a greater sense of control and responsibility for our emotional lives, recognizing that we are not simply at the mercy of our feelings but actively participate in their creation. We are not passive receivers of sensory input but active constructors of our emotional lives. This has implications for everything from mental health to the legal system to our understanding of human nature itself.",
   "chapter_8": "Chapter 8 - A New Perspective: Rewiring Our Understanding of Human Nature: The theory of constructed emotion represents a radical departure from the classical view and provides an opportunity to redefine what it means to be human.\nThe theory of constructed emotion offers a radically different perspective on human nature, challenging the classical view that has dominated Western thought for centuries. In this new view, humans are not simply rational beings controlling their animalistic emotions, but active constructors of their own experiences. This perspective has profound implications for our understanding of responsibility, culture, and even the nature of the mind itself. The theory of constructed emotion emphasizes the intertwined nature of mind, body, and culture. It suggests that the human brain is not pre-programmed with specific emotional responses but is wired to learn and adapt to its environment, creating diverse kinds of minds shaped by the cultures they inhabit. This challenges the idea that humans are fundamentally the same, suggesting instead that our experiences, shaped by culture and language, play a crucial role in who we become. This new perspective also highlights the importance of personal responsibility. We are not at the mercy of our emotions, but active participants in their construction. This means we have a degree of responsibility not only for our actions but also for the concepts that shape our perceptions and experiences. This responsibility extends beyond ourselves, as our actions and words influence the wiring of other people's brains, contributing to the social reality we share. The theory of constructed emotion calls for a shift away from seeking essences and certainty, toward embracing variation and complexity. It encourages us to be skeptical of our own perceptions and beliefs, recognizing that they are actively constructed by our brains and shaped by our culture. This understanding allows us to be more open-minded, to question our assumptions, and to recognize that our own experience is not the only valid one. And yet, the classical view of emotion remains deeply entrenched in our culture, from popular psychology to the legal system. This view, rooted in essentialism, assumes that emotions are universal, inborn, and have distinct fingerprints in the brain and body. It also assumes that we can accurately recognize emotions in others based on their facial expressions. This idea can be seen in everything from the use of the “basic emotion method” to research, to assumptions built into the American legal system. However, as neuroscience advances, it's clear that this classical view is not supported by evidence. The theory of constructed emotion offers a new way forward, recognizing that emotions are real, but real as constructions, shaped by our brains, our bodies, and the cultures we inhabit. This is a paradigm shift in our scientific understanding of emotion."
